        <h2>About me!</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Chris Ahn and I grew up in Cary, 
            North Carolina. I graduated from UNC-Chapel hill with 
            an Economics degree, but recently found a great passion and 
            drive for coding! Being able to manipulate web applications 
            and other programs with code and seeing it all come together
            is really exciting to me! I look forward to developing my skills
            as a programmer, feel free to see what I have done so far!
        </p>
